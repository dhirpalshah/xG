`pip install -e .[dev]`

# To do

## Figure out our output
- Find good resources to learn from
- Try to run other code to see if it works (Danny)

## Figure out code flow
- Create make files / installation guide (Dhirpal)
- Preprocess (Danny)
- Find best fit model classification

## Additional steps
- Rolling xG (throughout the match?)
