# xG
Our side project to attempt to calculate football's Expected Goals (xG) statistic better than traditional methods.


# To do

## Are we doing .ipynb or .py
- I think we go with .py

## Figure out our output
- Find good resources to learn from
- Try to run other code to see if it works

## Figure out code flow
- Create make files / installation guide (Dhirpal)
- Preprocess (Danny)
- Find best fit model classification

## Additional steps
- Rolling xG (throughout the match?)
